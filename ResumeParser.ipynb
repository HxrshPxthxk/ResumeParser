Built them using SVG, Canvas, and Open-source libraries like Apache Echarts, d3, ng-zorro, and ag-grid.\\nDeveloped 10+ data sources by integrating 3rd party APIs from facebook, google, shopify, snapchat, etc. Built data connectors using forms and oAuth2 based approaches.\\nImplemented features: ticketing system, billing service, user management, rich-text-editor enabled notes, admin panel, RBACs & Tier-Based User Restriction Service, chart alerts, dashboard and charting related - page & group filters, external share, save as pdf, slideshow mode.\\nStabilised the app by reducing the bugs by 90% within a quarter of joining and thereon maintained a <5% bug-to-new-feature ratio\\nRedesigned API responses by making proper use of cohesion and coupling concepts. Refactored the centralised state management service where RxJS leaks were prominent. Built a tracking service that could facilitate Root Cause Analysis for high-impact causing issues by logging the user actions, code flow, and modifications in the source-of-truth.\\nEstablished an AWS pipeline for dev, stage, and prod environments to automate releases. Set up a release and signoff process in place.\\nEnhanced the User Experience and Interface which led to a doubling of the average time spent on the app and improved demo-to-trial ratio\\nPrepared a UX + lighthouse report along with the design team wherein we identified some quick wins and established other long-term procedures as a part of design signoff process\\nImplemented driver.js for product demos instead of video onboarding, introduced setup guides, help, and getting started CTAs, brought in micro-interactions, changed the entire app theme along with the component library, and coordinated with designers for improved user messaging. Made sure we paid attention to details - alignments, spacing, color combos, adherence to design principles, etc.\\nTook lighthouse accessibility and best practices scores to around 90 from below 60.\\nRevamped the architecture of the core charting library and dashboard module to improve the first contentful paint time from 5s to 1.5s.\\nDid so by modularising the code into smaller chunks (modules and components), refactored memory leaks, reduced unnecessary API calls, performed asset compression and caching + enabled CDNs\\nImplemented lazing loading and lazy rendering (render stuff only when necessary - strategic breaking down of the entire page into groups)\\ncleaned up redundant services, unused components, packages, images and other assets\\nled migration from angular v9 to v15 along with all its dependencies\\nTook the lighthouse performance score from around 25 to 70\\nSingle-handedly leading the frontend development activities since Jan 2023. Active contributions in project planning and product discussions. Accustomed to working alongside the CEO, CTO along with fellow engineers and designers.\",\n",

Developed a web app that provided legal documents service (wills & codicils). Built an SEO-rich blog app for creators that converted .md files to blog posts.\\nBuilt a content automation platform (app + website) to help creators and marketers automate social media posts. Data once connected to Google Sheets would turn into ready-to-post images.\\nBuilt a philosophy-based app like goodreads + inshorts app, later turned into a content-only product.
